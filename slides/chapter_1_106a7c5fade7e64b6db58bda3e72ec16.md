`@script`
Previously we learned a little about sentiment analysis, and how it fits well with the tidyverse way of implementing data processing pipelines. In this video we will be teaching you about the very first step in a standard natural language processing pipeline: tokenization

## What is a token?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "1d28895992"
```

`@part1`
A text unit that can be analysed


`@script`
To start with, let us refresh what a token is, so that we can better understand the process of tokenization. A token is a text unit that can be analysed. This is usually a word, but can also be a phrase

## How does tidytext implement tokenization?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"

Reminder of what Tidy Data should look like:
- Each variable forms a column
- Each observation forms a row
- Each type of observation forms a table

`@script`
Tidytext is based on the following principles: Each variable is a column, each observation is a row and each type of observational unit is a table.

## Let's practice!
